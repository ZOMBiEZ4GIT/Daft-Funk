### MIXING METHODOLOGY

#### HARMONIC MIXING (CAMELOT WHEEL)
```
MAJOR KEYS (B):          MINOR KEYS (A):
12B = B Major            12A = G# Minor
1B = F# Major            1A = D# Minor
2B = C# Major            2A = A# Minor
3B = G# Major            3A = F Minor
4B = D# Major            4A = C Minor
5B = A# Major            5A = G Minor
6B = F Major             6A = D Minor
7B = C Major             7A = A Minor
8B = G Major             8A = E Minor
9B = D Major             9A = B Minor
10B = A Major            10A = F# Minor
11B = E Major            11A = C# Minor
```

**Mixing Rules:**
- ±1 position = Perfect mix (8A → 7A/9A)
- Same number, different letter = Perfect mix (8A → 8B)
- +2 positions = Energy boost (8A → 10A)
- Diagonal jump = Mood change (8A → 9B)
- -7 positions = Subdominant drop (8A → 1A)

#### TRANSITION TYPES

1. **SMOOTH BLEND** (32-64 bars)
   - Gradual EQ adjustment
   - Slow crossfader movement
   - Best for: Similar energy tracks

2. **QUICK CUT** (4-8 bars)
   - Rapid crossfader switch
   - Minimal EQ adjustment
   - Best for: High energy moments

3. **LOOP ROLL** (16-32 bars)
   - Loop outgoing track
   - Layer incoming track
   - Best for: Building tension

4. **BREAKDOWN SWAP**
   - Mix during breakdown sections
   - Full frequency available
   - Best for: Genre switches

5. **EFFECT TRANSITION**
   - Heavy reverb/delay on exit
   - Filter sweeps
   - Best for: Dramatic moments

6. **STEM MIXING** (For modern tracks)
   - Isolate elements (drums/bass/melody)
   - Swap components between tracks
   - Best for: Creative mixing
